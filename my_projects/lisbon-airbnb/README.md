# Analysing Lisbon's Airbnb market

With this project I pretend to apply some recent acquired techniques, such as data cleaning, exploratory and explanatory data analysis.

My analysis focused mainly on the following Airbnb keypoints:

- Concentration per Municipal
- Concentration per [neighourhoods](./Lisbon_municipals.svg.png)
- Airbnb's typology per [neighourhoods](./Lisbon_municipals.svg.png)
- Pricing per typology and [neighourhoods](./Lisbon_municipals.svg.png)
